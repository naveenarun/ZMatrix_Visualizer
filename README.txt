ZMatrix Visualizer
==================

Uses an input Z-Matrix to render an output VPython molecule with Cartesian Coordinates
Requires VPython 2.7 or lower.

==================
Instructions:
==================
To immediately start using the program, run the program in VPython (preferably using VIDLE).
The program will search the program directory for all *.zmat files. Choose from the displayed
files using the assigned number, and then specify (y/n) whether you want to display labels.

In the program window (not the Visual window), the Cartesian coordinates of the molecule will
be displayed.

Happy visualizing!

==================
KNOWN BUGS:
-Cannot read files that contain commas in the Atoms space
-Sometimes makes errors based on format; if this error occurs,try to make input file format
 as similar to the originally included files as possible
